<!-- Short description text above the bar -->
<p>Progress (demo):</p>

<!--
  Progress bar container:
  - Acts as the "empty" background of the progress bar.
  - The .progress class can be styled in CSS to set its width,
    height, border-radius, and background color (like light gray).
-->
<div class="progress">

  <!--
    Filled bar section:
    - Represents the "completed" portion of progress.
    - The inline style width:60% controls how much of the bar is filled.
    - The .bar class is styled in CSS to set the color (like blue) and rounded edges.
    - For M1, this is hard-coded to 60% just for visual demo.
    - Later (in M2+), this width could come from real data (e.g., {{ progress }}%).
  -->
  <div class="bar" style="width:60%"></div>
</div>

<!--
  Simple label text showing numeric percentage.
  Hard-coded for M1 to match the width above.
-->
<p>60% Complete (hard-coded for M1)</p>

<!--
  A disabled button placeholder.
  Shows where user interaction will go later
  (for example, marking a lesson as complete in M2).
-->
<button disabled>Mark as done (not implemented)</button>
